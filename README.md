# Customer Churn Analysis using Machine Learning

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn using a real-world telecom dataset and building a machine learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to leave the service.

The goal of this project is to understand the key factors behind customer churn and demonstrate an end-to-end data science workflow.

## Dataset

- Telecom Customer Churn dataset (public dataset)
- 7,043 customer records
- 21 features including:
  - Customer demographics
  - Subscription details
  - Billing information
  - Service usage
- Target variable: `Churn`

---

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Google Colab  

---

## Project Workflow

1. Loaded the dataset from a public GitHub source
2. Cleaned the data and handled missing values
3. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Converted categorical variables using one-hot encoding
5. Split data into training and testing sets
6. Applied feature scaling
7. Trained a Logistic Regression model
8. Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
9. Compared results with a Random Forest model

## Key Insights

- Customers with month-to-month contracts have a higher churn rate
- Higher monthly charges increase the likelihood of churn
- Long-term customers are less likely to leave
- Contract type plays a major role in customer retention

---

## Results

- Logistic Regression achieved stable performance after feature scaling
- Random Forest was used for model comparison
- The project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline

---

## How to Run the Project

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run all cells from top to bottom
3. The dataset loads automatically using a public link
4. No manual dataset download is required
